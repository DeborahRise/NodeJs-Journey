# My NodeJS Journey

## About The Journey

As a full stack software Engineer, I know that learning some tools useful on the back end is a must, hence, the journey I am embarking on.

Excited about this path.

Let's Go!

## 1. The Mysterious NaN in Temperature Conversion ❄️🔥

**Question:** Why is my temperature conversion returning `NaN`?  
**Error:** A faulty multiplication operation led to unexpected results.  
**Solution:** Corrected the logic for Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion and voilà, it worked! 🌡️

---

## 2. Git Commit Adventures 📝

**Question:** How do I add and commit each file individually?  
**Solution:** I learned how to properly add and commit changes in Git, ensuring that every single modification was tracked with a detailed commit message. My Git game leveled up! 📈

---

## 3. The Curious Case of the Crashing Server 💥

**Question:** Why does my server crash when handling requests?  
**Error:** Incorrectly managing response chunks and missing key checks led to server crashes.  
**Solution:** Fixed the logic, handled the response correctly, and the server ran smoothly without hiccups! 🎉

---

## 4. EventEmitter Mysteries 🎙️

**Question:** How do I use EventEmitter correctly?  
**Error:** Tried to use EventEmitter methods without creating an instance—oops!  
**Solution:** Properly created an EventEmitter instance, registered events, and emitted them like a pro. It felt like magic! ✨

---

## 5. Crypto Conundrums 🔐

**Question:** Why can’t I use shorter key lengths in my encryption?  
**Error:** Some algorithms demand specific key lengths.  
**Solution:** Switched to an algorithm that allowed shorter key lengths or padded the key to meet the requirements. Encrypting and decrypting like a secret agent now! 🕵️‍♀️

---

## 6. The File System Funhouse 🗂️

**Question:** How do I asynchronously read and write files in Node.js?  
**Error:** Missed importing the `fs/promises` module—whoops!  
**Solution:** Imported the correct module and performed file operations with ease. Now, my files behave just the way I want them to! 🛠️

---

## 7. Middleware Madness 🛣️

**Question:** How do I use middleware functions in my server?  
**Solution:** Created custom middleware for logging requests and setting response headers. Each middleware function passed control to the next one seamlessly. A real middleware masterclass! 🧙‍♂️

---

## 8. New User POST Problem 🧍

**Question:** Why does my server crash when I try to create a new user?  
**Error:** Mishandling data chunks during a POST request led to server crashes.  
**Solution:** Correctly managed incoming data with `req.on('data', ...)` and `req.on('end', ...)`. Now I can create new users without a hitch! 👥

---

## 9. Real-time Events & Custom EventEmitters 🔔

**Question:** How can I create custom events and handle them in real-time?  
**Solution:** Used `EventEmitter` to set up custom events that could be emitted and listened to at any time. From greetings to farewells, my events were on point! 🥳

### Final Thoughts 🎉

What a journey it’s been! From debugging crashing servers to mastering middleware, EventEmitters, and even cryptography, my Node.js adventure has been full of learning and growth. Each question led to a deeper understanding of the inner workings of Node.js, and I’m excited to keep building on this foundation.

Thanks for joining me on this ride. The code is just the beginning—let’s keep exploring, building, and having fun with Node.js! 🌍💻
